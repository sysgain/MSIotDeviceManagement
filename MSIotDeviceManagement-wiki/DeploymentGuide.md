## 1 Deployment Guide 

This Document explains about how to deploy White Goods solution using ARM Template. In this Document explained about two ways of deploying solution.

* Using Azure portal
* Using Azure CLI

This document explains about input parameters, output parameters and points to be noted while deploying ARM Template.

## 2 Prerequisites for Deploying ARM Template

Create an application in Azure Active Directory.

### 2.1 Integrating applications with Azure Active Directory

Any application that wants to use the capabilities of Azure AD must first be registered in an Azure AD tenant. This registration process involves giving Azure AD details about your application, such as the URL where itâ€™s located, the URL to send replies after a user is authenticated, the URI that identifies the app, and so on.

#### 2.1.1 To register a new application using the Azure portal

1. **Sign in** to the **Azure portal**.

2. In the left-hand navigation pane, **click** the **Azure Active Directory** service, click **App registrations** and click **New application registration**.

## 4 Getting started

Azure Resource Manager allows you to provision your applications using a declarative template. In a single template, you can deploy multiple services along with their dependencies. The template consists of JSON and expressions that you can use to construct values for your deployment. You use the same template to repeatedly deploy your application during every stage of the application lifecycle.

Resource Manager provides a consistent management layer to perform tasks through Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, Azure portal, REST API, and client SDKs.

Resource manager provides the following feature:

* Deploy, manage, and monitor all the resources for your solution as a group, rather than handling these resources individually.
* Repeatedly deploy your solution through the development lifecycle and your resources are deployed in a consistent state.
* Manage your infrastructure through declarative templates rather than scripts.
* Define the dependencies between resources so they're deployed in the correct order.
* Apply access control to all services in your resource group because Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is natively integrated into the management platform.
* Apply tags to resources to logically organize all the resources in your subscription.

### 5.5 Claim your Device

After you install Visual Studio and the SDK, you must claim your device. Claim your device only once. 

Every device has a unique and immutable Azure Sphere device ID that the Azure Sphere security service uses to identify and authenticate it. Before you update the device software or develop applications for the device, you must claim the device. Claiming the device associates it with your Azure Sphere tenant.

Refer below link for more information on creating a Tenant
**https://github.com/ooha-m/MSIotDeviceManagement/raw/master/Documentation/HowToCreateATenant.docx** 

Before you claim a device, be sure that you are logged in to the tenant that you plan to use with Azure Sphere services.

Refer the cutil login command in the Command-line Utilities from below link for more information
**https://github.com/ooha-m/MSIotDeviceManagement/raw/master/Documentation/CommandLineUtilities.docx**

**To claim your device:**

1. Connect your board to the PC by USB. 

2. Open an Azure Sphere Developer Command Prompt. To find the Azure Sphere Developer Command Prompt, click the Start button and type Azure Sphere.

3. **Run** the **cutil cloud utility** with the device command as follows:

```
cutil device claim --attached
```

4.	This command reads the Azure Sphere device ID from the board and associates it with your current tenant. If you are prompted to log in to Microsoft Azure, do so using your Azure Sphere credentials.

### 5.6 Add to Device Group

Before you configure Wi-Fi on your device, you must add it to the Microsoft-created System Software device group. The group is named System Software and has the following device group ID:

**63bbe6ea-14be-4d1a-a6e7-03591d882b42**

Use the following command to add your device to the group:

```
Cutil device setdg â€“attached â€“devicegroupid  63bbe6ea-14be-4d1a-a6e7-03591d882b42
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/ooha-m/MSIotDeviceManagement/raw/master/Images/64.png">
</p>

### 5.7 Configure Wi-Fi

You must configure the device for Wi-Fi before it can communicate with the Azure IoT Hub or receive over-the-air (OTA) updates.

#### 5.7.1 To Set up Wi-Fi on your Device

1.	If your device is not connected to your PC, connect it now.

2.	**Open** an **Azure Sphere Developer Command Prompt** and issue a command in the following form:

```
dutil wifi add â€“s <xxxxxxx> -k <XXXXXXXXX>
```
3.	The **-s flag** specifies the network SSID, and the **-k flag** specifies the WPA2 key. Network SSIDs are case-sensitive and can include only ASCII characters. To add an open Wi-Fi access point, omit the -k flag.

4. You should see:

### 5.8 Connect to IoT Hub

#### 5.8.1 Set Up Microsoft Azure Credentials

To run this sample, you must have a Microsoft Azure subscription and an IoT Hub. 

After you set up the subscription, you can create a hub. Log into the Azure Portal and follow these instructions to set up your hub.

#### 5.8.2 Add your Device to the IoT Hub

To use an IoT Hub in an Azure Sphere application, you identify the IoT Hub that you plan to use and then add your device to that hub. The connected service retrieves the IoT Hub connection string and records it in a file named azure_iot_hub.c. The connected service then adds azure_iot_hub.c and the header file azure_iot_hub.h to your application.
